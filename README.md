### Description
    The purpose of this python program for the audience, is to view your favorite movie trailers with basic information such as title, storyline on commandline, cover image, and youtube trailer. Include in this repository movie file is two folders, one named the "Art of Percption" and the other named the "Art of Perception_Compiled". The "Art of Perception" folder is used for testing purposes. You may just open the art of perception_compile if you wish.

### Dependencies 
Python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ "Download")

Git [here](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) --optional this is need for the command git clone 
    **_you may just download the repository *zip file *Extract it then *Execute entertainment.py then finally *Execute freshtomatoes.html_** 
     
### Install
    Simply clone this git repository
### Run the program 
    To run the program, from within the "Art of Perception" folder: 
                    * 1. Excute entertainment.py --May need to do this twice to see the html
                    * 2. If the html is not already loaded in the default browser, then click on the generated html file (freshtomatoes.html) 
## Example
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nolansingroy/Movie_Website.git
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
 

## Edit
    To edit the program you may refactor entertainment.py's instances of media.py. The media class contains string parameters of (title, storyline, picture_URL, youtube_trailer_url). Be sure to check your code is up to python standards! During the development of this program http://pep8online.com was very useful. 

## How it works
    The entertainment.py file generates a website (.html file) using freshtomatoes.py with the specific movie trailers and basic information pulling from the parent class media.py.
